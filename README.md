# ApeMemoryGame

This is a little web project with Javascript and Jquery. You must remember the Numbers, that are then hidden by the white squares. Your task is to remember where each number was and click on the corresponding square. You can look up the score of chimpanzees in that game and try to beat them.

Note: Still under heavy development.
